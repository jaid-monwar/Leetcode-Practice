# Instructions:
# LL: Has Loop (âš¡Interview Question)
# Write a method called has_loop that is part of the linked list class.

# The method should be able to detect if there is a cycle or loop present in the linked list.

# The method should utilize Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm, also known as the "tortoise and hare" algorithm, to determine the presence of a loop efficiently.

# The method should follow these guidelines:



# Create two pointers, slow and fast, both initially pointing to the head of the linked list.

# Traverse the list with the slow pointer moving one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time.

# If there is a loop in the list, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer. If this occurs, the method should return True.

# If the fast pointer reaches the end of the list or encounters a None value, it means there is no loop in the list. In this case, the method should return False.
